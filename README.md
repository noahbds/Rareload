## Data & Storage

- Addon settings: data/rareload/addon_state.json
- Per-map player positions: data/rareload/player*positions*<map>.json
- Global inventory: data/rareload/global_inventory.json
- Anti-stuck profiles: data/rareload/anti_stuck_profiles/\*.json
- Current anti-stuck profile: data/rareload/anti_stuck_current.json

## Visual Debug

- Toolscreen: shows addon status, features, and auto-save progress bar
- Reload overlay: shows whether previous position data exists
- Phantoms: ghost models rendered at saved positions (when debug enabled)

## Installation

- Install on server and/or client
- Restart GMod/server
- Access Toolgun > Utilities > Rareload > Rareload Configuration
- Ensure permissions are configured for your admins/players

## Troubleshooting

- Not spawning correctly: enable debug and use anti-stuck debug panel
- No previous position: the reload overlay will indicate ‚ÄúNo Position Data‚Äù
- Entities/NPCs missing: verify map entity/NPC toggles are enabled and permissions allow management
- Global inventory not persisting: ensure retainGlobalInventory is enabled
- Permissions: server must initialize permission system; only permitted users can toggle settings or access tools
