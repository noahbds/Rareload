# RareLoad - Gmod Addon [Keep Position and Weapons when reloading]

Features:

1. Position Saving and Respawning:

   - Save Position Button: Easily store your current location with a click, ensuring you can respawn exactly where you want, even after quitting the game, reloading the map or even after player death.

   - Auto Saving: Choose to enable automatic position saving at regular intervals for convenience.

   - KeepInventory : Allow to keep your weapons that you had when you last saved, when respawning, it will automaticly put the weapon held when you last saved. This option can be disabled. (Death count as respawn, so you keep your weapons after death)

2. Configuration in the Tool Menu:

   - Access all settings through the tool menu for seamless customization.
   - Clear indication with intuitive design: Enabled buttons are highlighted in blue, while disabled ones are red.

3. Respawn Options:

   - Toggle Respawn with Previous Move Type: Choose whether to respawn with the same movement type (e.g., noclip) as when the position was saved.

   - If the option is disabled, the add-on takes precautions to prevent issues:

     - Avoiding Wall Respawn: Attempts to prevent respawning inside walls, although not always foolproof.
     - Safe Falling: Ensures you respawn at the closest walkable ground, preventing accidental falls.
     - Avoiding Spawning in Water : It will spawn you on the nearest ground if your spawn point was above or in water.
     - If impossible due to map constraints, defaults to the map's default spawn point.

4. User Control:

   - Enable/Disable Anytime: Have the flexibility to turn the add-on on or off at any point.
   - Basic Admin Restrictions: Ensures that only authorized users can access and use the add-on commands, maintaining server integrity.

Compatibility and Testing:

- I only tested It on singleplayer, but I added basic admin prevention

Note: This marks my debut in modding. While the code may be a bit untidy, it effectively serves its purpose for my personal use. As I am currently in the learning phase of coding, I appreciate your understanding and patience. Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement as I continue to enhance this addon.
